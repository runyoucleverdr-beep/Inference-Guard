# Session 06 — User Testing

## Overview

Session 06 evaluates how users interact with InferenceGuard under a silent-observer protocol. The current pilot includes four participants (P01–P04) across generative and controlled scenarios.

The evaluation focuses on:

- contextual disclosure;
- comprehension of privacy warnings;
- responses to privacy-preserving query rewriting;
- perceived usefulness; and
- willingness to adopt the system.

These results are preliminary and are intended to identify behavioral patterns and usability issues rather than support statistical conclusions.

## Current Participants

| Participant | Scenario | Mode | ADR | Usefulness | Would Use |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| P01 | Time-Off Planning | Generative | 1.0 | 1/10 | No |
| P02 | Workplace Conflict | Controlled | 1.0 | 5/10 | Yes |
| P03 | University Housing | Generative | 1.0 | 8/10 | Yes |
| P04 | Medication Follow-Up | Generative | 0.3 | 5–6/10 | No |
| P05 | Workplace Conflict | Controlled | 1.0 | 3/10 | Yes |

No pre-submission evaluator intervention was recorded for P01–P05.

## Preliminary Findings

### 1. Privacy Awareness Did Not Necessarily Lead to Adoption

Understanding an inferential privacy warning did not necessarily result in willingness to use the system.

P01 demonstrated correct warning comprehension but rated the system only 1/10 and indicated that they would not use it before submitting an AI query. The participant preferred allowing an LLM to retain some personal context to avoid repeatedly providing the same information and also expressed concern about whether the privacy tool itself might retain private information.

P04 similarly indicated a willingness to provide some personal information when doing so could improve the quality of an AI response.

In contrast, P05 correctly understood that the system identified occupation and education as privacy risks and indicated that they would use the system because they believed it could protect their privacy.

These observations suggest a potential tension between **privacy protection and personalization**, as well as individual differences in how users value privacy intervention.

These observations suggest a potential tension between **privacy protection and personalization**.

### 2. Perceived Protection Could Occur Without an Effective Rewrite

For P02 and P03, the system returned the original query without meaningful modification. Nevertheless, both participants accepted the output and reported positive attitudes toward the system.

P02 stated that the tool showed privacy risk and protected their privacy, while P03 rated the system's usefulness as 8/10.

P05 provides additional evidence of this pattern. The system correctly classified the query as **HIGH risk (0.75)**, primarily due to occupation (**0.75, HIGH**) and education (**0.45, MEDIUM**). However, the system-generated rewrite was identical to the original query. Despite the absence of an effective system rewrite, P05 stated that the program could protect their privacy and indicated that they would use it before sending a query.

This suggests a possible gap between **perceived protection and observable privacy intervention**. A privacy warning may increase the user's perception of protection even when the query itself remains unchanged.

### 3. Technical Privacy Metrics Were Not Fully Interpretable

P03 explicitly asked about the meanings of **Joint Entropy** and **Leakage Delta**.

This observation suggests that these technical metrics are not necessarily self-explanatory to users. Although they may be useful for system evaluation, a participant-facing interface may require plain-language explanations or a simpler presentation.

### 4. Users Expressed Different Privacy–Utility Preferences

Participants did not demonstrate a uniform preference for stronger privacy protection.

P01 preferred retaining contextual information to support personalization, while P04 was willing to disclose some personal information when it could improve the relevance of the AI response. In contrast, P02 and P03 expressed greater willingness to use the privacy tool.

These observations suggest that inferential privacy protection may need to support **selective disclosure** rather than assume that minimizing disclosure is always the user's preferred outcome.

### 5. User Editing Provided a new Perspective of Privacy Protection
P05 accepted the system output with manual edits. Edits made were changing **master degree** to **phd degree**, **seven years of experience** to **ten years**. In this way, user described "creating a shadow character of myself" in front of AI. No real details provided, but the structure and purpose of the original query can be preserved.

## Observed System Behavior

The system did not meaningfully modify the original queries for P01, P02, or P03 despite presenting privacy-risk information.

For P04, the recorded system log contained a modification of explicit age information, while the researcher observed that this modification was not clearly presented in the interface.

The current pilot therefore indicates a potential mismatch among:

**risk detection → risk communication → rewriting behavior → user perception**

In particular, P05 suggests that successful risk detection does not necessarily lead to successful risk mitigation, while users may still perceive the system as providing privacy protection.

This relationship should be further discussed in futher sessions.

## Preliminary Conclusion

The first four Session 06 tests suggest that the usability of InferenceGuard depends on more than inference-risk detection alone.

Three emerging dimensions appear particularly important:

1. whether users understand what information may be inferred from their queries;
2. whether users can distinguish a privacy warning from an actual privacy intervention; and
3. whether the privacy benefit of removing contextual information outweighs the perceived loss of personalization or response quality.

4. whether user or system edits actually reduce inferential disclosure rather than simply substitute one sensitive value for another.

P05 strengthens the evidence for a distinction between **risk detection and privacy intervention**. Although the system correctly identified high inferential risk and the participant correctly understood the warning, the system did not modify the risky query. The participant nevertheless perceived the tool as privacy-protective and manually changed specific sensitive values without removing the underlying disclosure attributes.

At this stage, these findings should be treated as exploratory rather than generalizable. However, the P01–P05 results indicate that **trust calibration, privacy–utility preferences, transparency of rewrite behavior, and the effectiveness of privacy-preserving edits** are important dimensions for the remaining Session 06 evaluation.
